# MOVIE-DATA-ANALYSIS-NETFLIX

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of over 9,000 movies available on Netflix. Using data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) techniques, the goal is to extract meaningful insights to support business decisions such as content acquisition and user engagement strategies.

## Objectives

The following key questions will be answered through data analysis:

1. **Most Frequent Genre**  
   Identify the most frequently occurring genre among all movies on Netflix.

2. **Highest Vote Average**  
   Determine which movie has the highest average vote (from the `vote_avg` column).

3. **Most Popular Movie**  
   Find the movie with the highest popularity and identify its genre.

4. **Least Popular Movie**  
   Find the movie with the lowest popularity and identify its genre.

5. **Most Active Production Year**  
   Identify the year in which the most movies were released (filmed).
